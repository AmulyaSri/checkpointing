+#Title: OVPL Checkpointing for Data Services
+#Author: Prakash B Hegade

Following are the checkpoints which seem to be appropriate to be logged for the data services. The classification is done with respect to the files.

** AdapterServer.py
- vm_id
- the success / failure status of init_vm
- adapter_name
- adapter_port

** CentOSVZAdapter.py
- id_address
- am_spec

** ControllerServer.py
- config_spec

** Controller.py
- lab_spec: lab_id, lab_src_url, revision_tag
- lab_status
- ip
- vmmgrurl


Whenever lab spec is updated
- lab_id
- lab_src_url
- revision_tag

Whenever a lab is updated
- released_by
- released_on

When lab is undeployed
- lab_id
